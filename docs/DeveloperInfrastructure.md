# Developer Infrastructure

Estimates of developer resources and difficulty for potential blockchain platforms.




## NEAR Protocol

### Rust

A highly praised general purpose programming language designed for performance and safety. Has a steep learning curve but is incredibly powerful.

**Previous Experience :** Some

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Language Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Decent

**Blockchain Example Code:** Decent

### Typescript

A strictly typed superset of JavaScript, allows development of both front-end and smart contracts in the same language.

**Previous Experience :** None

**Difficulty:** Easy/Medium

**Language Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Minimal

**Blockchain Example Code:** Minimal




## Polygon

### Solidity

The original programming language for Ethereum, a high level Object-oriented language with extensive use.

**Previous Experience:** Some

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Language Documentation:** Decent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Example Code:** Excellent

### Vyper

A python-ic programming language with strong typing. Deliberately fewer features than solidity with the intent of making contracts more secure and easier to audit.

**Previous Experience:** None

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Language Documentation:** Decent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Example Code:** Excellent




## Tezos

### Archetype

A domain-specific language (DSL) to develop smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain with a specific focus on security and formal verification of contracts. Protip: verification is **HARD**

**Previous Experience:** Some (Dafny)

**Difficulty:** Beyond Brutal

**Language Documentation:** Decent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Minimal

**Blockchain Example Code:** Minimal


### Fi

A high-level language based on JavaScript and Solidity. The Fi language is intended to be a much closer experience to programming smart contracts in Solidity. Omitted as it is in alpha


### LIGO

LIGO is a statically typed, high-level language for smart contracts that compiles down to Michelson. Supports multiple syntaxes but leans towards functional ideologies. Still in beta phase.

**Previous Experience:** None

**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard

**Language Documentation:** 

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** 

**Blockchain Example Code:** 


### Morley

Morley provides a library to write Tezos smart contracts in Haskell. Still under development.

**Previous Experience:** Some (Haskell)

**Difficulty:** Brutal

**Language Documentation:** Decent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Minimal

**Blockchain Example Code:** Minimal


### SmartPy

SmartPy is a high-level smart contract language that enables developers to use Python to write contracts, which can be compiled to Michelson.

**Previous Experience:** Lots (Python)

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Language Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Specific Documentation:** Excellent

**Blockchain Example Code:** Excellent



## Solana

### Rust

A highly praised general purpose programming language designed for performance and safety. Has a steep learning curve but is incredibly powerful.

**Previous Experience :** Some

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Language Documentation:** Excellent
