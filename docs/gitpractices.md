# Git Best Practices

## Make clean, single-purpose commits

Keep commits as small and focused as possible, this can help in many ways such as the following.

- Simplify code reviews
- Easier to roll back individual changes
- Better tracking of changes

## Provide good commit messages

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Commit early and often

Instead of waiting to make the commit perfect, it is better to work in small chunks and keep committing your work. It helps you keep your code updated with the latest changes so that you avoid conflicts.

Additionally, Git only takes responsibility for your data when you commit. It helps you from losing work or reverting changes.
